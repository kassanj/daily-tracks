# Daily Tracks

Sometimes discovering music on Spotify can feel overwhelming. Daily Tracks works to appease that overload of information by introducing one track to a curious music consumer, daily. This will allow for a more organic music discovery experience. 

Daily Tracks was built in React/Node. It uses the Spotify API to render tracks and artists. A user can like and unlike a track, which then gets saved into their Spotify Premium account. A user can also play and pause those tracks.
